This pack was modeled using Blender 4.0 and Substance Painter. You can use the models as you wish in any projects you want!

- The models are in fbx format
- The textures are in 128 to 512, according to the UV and object size

This pack was created for a mockup scene, so there are some issues, such as certain parts of the UV being diagonal, etc. But I hope the pack may be helpful for you!
